<h3>dirty_data-project</h3>
<p> Data cleaning project using R. Involved cleaning text, numerical elements and handling NA in different forms. Cleaning included creating pivot tables from data, detecting & extracting strings, recoding data, changing data types, etc.
Used Tidyverse to answer analysis questions, provided insights based on analysis.</p>

<p>I also tried this in Python. At that time, I haven't learnt Pandas yet, so there are a lot of loops and not very good. </p>
