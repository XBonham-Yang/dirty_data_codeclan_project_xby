  select(emotion) %>% 
  drop_na(emotion) %>% 
  summarise (num = n())
 #1299017 ratings were giving out throughout the three years. 
```

What was the average age of people who are going out trick or treating?
```{r}
candy %>% 
  filter(going_out == 'Yes') %>%
  summarise(avg_age = round(mean(age, na.rm= TRUE)))
#36?????ummmmmmmm very strange. 
```

What was the average age of people who are not going trick or treating?
```{r}
candy %>% 
  filter(going_out == 'No') %>%
  summarise(avg_age = round(mean(age, na.rm= TRUE)))
#41 average age 
```

For each of joy, despair and meh, which candy bar received the most of these ratings?
```{r}
candy %>% 
  drop_na(emotion) %>% 
  group_by(emotion, sweets) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  slice_max(count)

#Broken glow stick is most-DESPAIR	with count 12780
#Any full-sized candy bar is most-joy with count	12266
#Lollipops	is most - MEH with count 4363	
```

candy %>% 
  filter(sweets == 'Starburst' ,
         emotion == 'DESPAIR') %>% 
  summarise(total_n = n())
#2887 in total across 3 years.
```

For the next three questions, count despair as -1, joy as +1, and meh as 0.


```{r}
candy_rate <- candy %>% 
  mutate(rating = case_when(emotion == 'JOY' ~ 1,
                            emotion == 'DESPAIR' ~ -1,
                            emotion == 'MEH' ~ 0,
                            TRUE ~ NA_real_))
```
